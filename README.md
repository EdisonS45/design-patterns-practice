# **Design Patterns in Java Practice** 🚀

Welcome to my **Design Patterns Practice Repository**! This repository contains Java-based implementations of commonly used **Design Patterns**, which I am learning and practicing to strengthen my understanding of Object-Oriented Design principles.

---

## **What are Design Patterns?** 📚

Design Patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software design. Design Patterns help developers to write code that is easy to understand and maintainable. It provides common terminologies and solutions to common challenges in software development.

---

## **Patterns Covered** 🌟

Here is the list of Design Patterns implemented in this repository. The list will be updated as I explore and add more patterns.

1. **Creational Patterns**
    - [x] Singleton Pattern
    - [x] Factory Pattern
    - [ ] Abstract Factory Pattern
    - [ ] Builder Pattern
    - [ ] Prototype Pattern

2. **Structural Patterns**
    - [ ] Adapter Pattern
    - [ ] Decorator Pattern
    - [ ] Composite Pattern
    - [ ] Proxy Pattern

3. **Behavioral Patterns**
    - [ ] Strategy Pattern
    - [ ] Observer Pattern
    - [ ] Command Pattern
    - [ ] Template Method Pattern
